            <p>This website was made for a boy &#40;who until further notice will remain anonymous&#41; to post his stories so everyone &#40;mainly King's College students&#41; can read and enjoy.</p>

            <p>This website wasn't actually made by me. I just downloaded the resouces for the website. I was at that time just learning how to host a website. But it is very nice and catches the eye and I also used a lot of Dummy text.</p>

            <p>This was my first ever made and hosted website. I made it and hosted it on Infinityfree. Infinity free is an hosting site which isn't so good but I used it because there isn't any way I'm going to generate money from here. I also used a lot of Dummy text. But all my future websites are going to be hosted on Bluehost.</p>
